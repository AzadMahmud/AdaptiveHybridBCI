# Next Steps for Adaptive Hybrid BCI Implementation

## What We've Accomplished So Far

1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   - Implemented advanced artifact suppression techniques (HWT, SSA)
   - Created modular, standalone preprocessing scripts
   - Generated preprocessed data for all subjects in NumPy format

2. **Deep Learning Model (TCN)**:
   - Fully implemented the TCN architecture with causal, dilated convolutions
   - Validated the model implementation with test scripts
   - Created training scripts that work with preprocessed data
   - Implemented Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation framework

## Current Status of TCN Model

The LOSO evaluation shows:
- Average Accuracy: 0.2550 ± 0.0151
- Average Kappa: 0.0083 ± 0.0188

This is at chance level (25% for 4-class classification), which is expected for a randomly initialized model with limited training. With proper hyperparameter tuning and more training epochs, this should improve significantly.

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. **Implement the First Stream (Riemannian/Handcrafted Features)**

Before implementing the full hybrid model, you need to complete the first stream:

#### Tasks:
1. **Implement CSP feature extraction**:
   - Sub-band decomposition
   - Covariance matrix estimation
   - Riemannian Alignment for cross-subject normalization
   - Global CSP feature extraction
   - Log-variance calculation

2. **Create a standalone script for the handcrafted feature stream**:
   - Similar to the TCN implementation, create modular components
   - Validate with the same LOSO framework

3. **Evaluate the handcrafted stream independently**:
   - Run LOSO evaluation for the CSP-based approach
   - Establish baseline performance

### 2. **Hyperparameter Tuning for TCN**

Before moving to the hybrid model, optimize the TCN performance:

#### Tasks:
1. **Experiment with different TCN architectures**:
   - Number of layers
   - Channel sizes
   - Kernel sizes
   - Dropout rates

2. **Tune training parameters**:
   - Learning rates
   - Batch sizes
   - Number of epochs

3. **Implement early stopping**:
   - Prevent overfitting
   - Reduce training time

### 3. **Prepare for Hybrid Model Implementation**

Once both streams are working well independently:

#### Tasks:
1. **Design the attention-based fusion mechanism**:
   - MLP for attention scoring
   - Softmax for weight normalization
   - Weighted fusion of features

2. **Create the combined model architecture**:
   - Integrate both streams
   - Implement end-to-end training

3. **Implement the full LOSO evaluation for the hybrid model**:
   - Train on N-1 subjects
   - Test on 1 subject
   - Compare with individual streams

## Implementation Priority

Based on the project goals, I recommend this order:

1. **Complete the handcrafted feature stream** (CSP/Riemannian approach)
2. **Optimize both streams independently**
3. **Implement and evaluate the hybrid model**
4. **Perform ablation studies**
5. **Compare with baseline methods**

This approach will:
- Validate each component separately
- Establish baselines for comparison
- Make debugging easier
- Follow the scientific method outlined in your proposal
