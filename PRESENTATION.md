# Adaptive Hybrid BCI - Progress Presentation

## 1. Project Overview

### Goal
Implement a subject-independent Motor Imagery BCI that requires minimal calibration for new users.

### Proposed Solution
A dual-stream architecture:
- **Branch A**: Handcrafted features using Riemannian geometry and CSP
- **Branch B**: Deep learning using Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)
- **Fusion**: Adaptive attention mechanism to weigh both streams

## 2. Completed Work

### A. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**What we built**:
- Complete preprocessing pipeline for BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a
- Advanced artifact removal (HWT and simplified SSA)
- Modular, reproducible scripts

**Key files**:
- `src/preprocessing/preprocess_pipeline.py`
- `src/preprocessing/artifact_removal.py`

**Demonstration**:
- Processed data for all 9 subjects
- Output: NumPy arrays ready for model training

### B. Deep Learning Model (TCN)

**What we built**:
- Full TCN implementation with causal dilated convolutions
- Residual connections and proper gradient flow
- Validation and training scripts

**Key files**:
- `src/models/tcn.py`
- `src/models/train_tcn_updated.py`

**Demonstration**:
- Model successfully processes EEG data (22 channels, 500 timepoints)
- Output: 64-dimensional feature vector

### C. Evaluation Framework

**What we built**:
- Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation
- Standard evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Kappa)

**Key files**:
- `src/models/loso_evaluation.py`

**Demonstration**:
- Results show subject-independent evaluation is working
- Average accuracy: 25.5% (at chance level for 4-class problem)

## 3. Technical Details

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Load raw GDF files
2. Bandpass filter (8-30 Hz)
3. Notch filter (50 Hz)
4. Epoch data (0.5-2.5s post-cue)
5. Artifact removal (HWT)
6. Save as NumPy arrays

### TCN Architecture
- Input: (batch, 22 channels, 500 timepoints)
- 4 temporal blocks with dilated convolutions
- Residual connections
- Output: 64-dimensional feature vector

### LOSO Evaluation
- Train on 8 subjects
- Test on 1 subject
- Repeat for all subjects
- Report average performance

## 4. Live Demonstration

### Show:
1. Project structure (`demo_progress.py`)
2. Preprocessed data files
3. TCN model validation
4. LOSO results

### Commands to run:
```bash
# Show project structure
python demo_progress.py

# Validate TCN model
cd src/models
python validate_tcn.py

# Run single subject training
python train_tcn_updated.py --subject_id A01 --epochs 2
```

## 5. Current Status

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- TCN model implementation
- Training and evaluation scripts
- LOSO cross-validation framework

### In Progress üîÑ
- Handcrafted feature extraction (Branch A)
- Attention-based fusion mechanism

### Next Steps ‚û°Ô∏è
1. Implement CSP/Riemannian features
2. Create attention-based fusion
3. Evaluate hybrid model
4. Compare with baselines

## 6. Key Achievements

1. **Modular Implementation**: Each component is standalone and testable
2. **Reproducibility**: Clear documentation and scripts
3. **Standard Evaluation**: LOSO framework follows BCI research best practices
4. **Foundation Set**: Ready for full hybrid model implementation

## 7. Challenges Addressed

1. **Artifact Removal**: Implemented HWT to improve signal quality
2. **Model Validation**: Created separate validation without requiring GPU
3. **Data Consistency**: Modular preprocessing handles all subjects uniformly
